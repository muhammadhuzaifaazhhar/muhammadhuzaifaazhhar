Session 5a - Internet Fundamentals/Social Media
Activity 1: "Digital Marketing Models: The Honeycomb model" [What activity did you complete?] In this activity, I learned "the Honeycomb Model, established by Kietzmann, Hermkens, and McCarthy in 2011, defines seven critical building pieces for effective social media strategy. These blocks include Identity, which focuses on user privacy and self-promotion tools, and Presence, which emphasizes managing a brand's immediacy, intimacy, and reality on social media. Building and strengthening Relationships within the network, monitoring and upgrading Reputation, implementing membership rules and protocols in Groups, evaluating and managing Conversations, and optimizing Sharing methods form the other major parts. In order to fully utilize this model, companies should assess their present strategy in relation to each building block, adjusting their plan according to how well it fits their particular objectives and target market. The final choice of social media platform should be in line with the unique requirements and goals of the company, even though the model helps with strategic refinement. It is possible to respond to changing user behaviors and trends by routinely reviewing the Honeycomb Model, which helps to continuously enhance the efficacy of social media."
