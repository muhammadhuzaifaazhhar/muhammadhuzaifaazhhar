Session 5a - Internet Fundamentals/Social Media
Activity 1: "Digital Marketing Models: The Honeycomb model" [What activity did you complete?] In this activity, I learned "the Honeycomb Model, established by Kietzmann, Hermkens, and McCarthy in 2011, defines seven critical building pieces for effective social media strategy. These blocks include Identity, which focuses on user privacy and self-promotion tools, and Presence, which emphasizes managing a brand's immediacy, intimacy, and reality on social media. Building and strengthening Relationships within the network, monitoring and upgrading Reputation, implementing membership rules and protocols in Groups, evaluating and managing Conversations, and optimizing Sharing methods form the other major parts. In order to fully utilize this model, companies should assess their present strategy in relation to each building block, adjusting their plan according to how well it fits their particular objectives and target market. The final choice of social media platform should be in line with the unique requirements and goals of the company, even though the model helps with strategic refinement."

In this activity, I will be able to apply "In order to fully utilize this model, companies should assess their present strategy in relation to each building block, adjusting their plan according to how well it fits their particular objectives and target market. The final choice of social media platform should be in line with the unique requirements and goals of the company, even though the model helps with strategic refinement. It is possible to respond to changing user behaviors and trends by routinely reviewing the Honeycomb Model, which helps to continuously enhance the efficacy of social media." for myself in my "current work environment". How? Businesses are urged to support user-generated content within privacy limitations by the first section, "Identity," which highlights the value of user self-promotion tools and data privacy safeguards. Storytelling and in-the-moment updates are key components of "presence," as they give the audience a concrete and instant context. "Relationships" encourages firms to create and maintain deep relationships with their audience by emphasizing the knowledge and management of a network's structural features. "Reputation" promotes proactive reputation management tactics by highlighting the necessity of keeping an eye on emotion, strength, and reach. Recognizing and following group norms is part of "groups," which also encourages companies to form or join pertinent organizations for community involvement.
Activity 2: "Facebook" [What activity did you complete?] In this activity, I learned "the Facebook app is a flexible extension of the Facebook social networking platform that is built for mobile devices running both iOS and Android. The software acts as a center, allowing users to interact with posts, images, and updates from pages they follow, groups, and friends through its dynamic News Feed. In order to promote a feeling of community, users may maintain their own profiles, connect with friends, join groups, and follow sites of interest. In addition to audio and video calling features, the integrated Messenger enables group and one-on-one communication. By letting users adjust settings and take advantage of features like two-factor authentication, the app places a high priority on security and privacy. ".

In this activity, I will be able to apply "with simplified multimedia sharing, users may share links, images, and videos straight from their mobile devices. The app also enhances the whole social media experience by integrating with other Facebook-owned sites like Instagram and WhatsApp. Consistent updates guarantee that customers have access to the newest features, enhancements, and bug fixes. The Facebook app continues to be a popular and dynamic medium for social interaction, information sharing, and community involvement because of its cross-platform compatibility and strong focus on accessibility." for myself in my "current work environment". How? Simplified multimedia sharing features enable users to simply share links, movies, and photographs from their mobile devices. Because of the app's integration with other Facebook-owned properties like Instagram and WhatsApp, a unified digital environment is created, improving social media usage in general.
