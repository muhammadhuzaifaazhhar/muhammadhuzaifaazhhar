    <p> In this assignment, I learned how to create a image, audio, and video. I learned the importance of effectively integrating multimedia elements, such as YouTube videos, into web pages. Specifically, I discovered that utilizing the "embed video" option provided by YouTube can solve challenges related to access denial and video loading issues. By obtaining the HTML code directly from YouTube's share feature, I gained insight into a straightforward method for seamlessly incorporating videos onto websites. This experience emphasized the significance of utilizing appropriate tools and techniques to ensure smooth integration of multimedia content, ultimately enhancing the user experience on web pages.
