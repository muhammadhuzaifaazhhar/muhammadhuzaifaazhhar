<h1>Assignment 8 - Summary</h1>
Session 2A - Internet Fundamentals/HTML
Activity 1: "HTML Introduction" [What activity did you complete?] In this activity, I learned "<!DOCTYPE html> is a declaration that opens HTML documents and makes sure the browser interprets them in accordance with HTML5 standards. The <head> and the <body> are the next two major portions that make up the structure of an HTML page. The document's meta-data, including the title that appears on the browser tab, links to CSS files for style, and scripts for JavaScript interactions, are all contained in the <head> element. Text, photos, videos, and interactive forms are all contained in the <body> element and are the real content that viewers can see. With the introduction of semantic components in HTML5, the online content structure now has a clearer meaning and is more accessible thanks to HTML progression." [Provide supportive information from the activity you completed. ]
In this activity, I will be able to apply "provide description" for myself in my "current work environment". How? The web's constantly evolving requirements are what propel HTML's ongoing progress. HTML advances in sophistication in tandem with web technology. Future HTML enhancements may provide even more semantic components, better forms, increased interaction, and expanded accessibility capabilities. This will guarantee that HTML stays at the vanguard of online technology, promoting innovation and preserving the open, accessible spirit of the web.
Activity 2: "HTML Introduction" [What activity did you complete?] In this activity, I learned "In addition, HTML serves as the basis for JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). HTML provides the structure, CSS styles the information to make it seem good, and JavaScript adds interaction to make the web page dynamic and interesting. HTML plays a crucial role in the web development ecosystem because of the way these three technologies work together to create complex online applications.". [Provide supportive information from the activity you completed. ]
In this activity, I will be able to apply "HTML is fundamental to the web and allows for the development of intricate, rich media experiences. It is more than simply a markup language. It is essential to web development since it not only gives web pages their structural foundation but also enables smooth interaction between JavaScript and CSS, which makes the internet possible." for myself in my "current work environment". How? Analyzing HTML's complexities and importance to web development in further detail reveals a complex technology that goes much beyond simple page construction. Combining HTML with CSS and JavaScript allows developers to create rich, dynamic, and easily navigable websites. HTML is more than simply the framework for a page.
