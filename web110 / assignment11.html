<h1>Assignment 11 - Summary</h1>
Session 11 - Internet Fundamentals/Web Accessibility
Activity 1: "What is accessibility" [What activity did you complete?] In this activity, I learned the process of creating websites that are useable by as many people as possible, regardless of their circumstances or abilities, is known as accessibility. Accessibility helps more than just those with impairments; it also helps other groups, such those who use mobile devices or have sluggish network connections.". [Provide supportive information from the activity you completed. ]
In this activity, I will be able to apply "accessibility span various aspects of web design and development. For example, individuals with visual impairments may rely on screen readers or screen magnification software to navigate websites. Developers need to ensure that web content is structured in a way that is compatible with these assistive technologies, including providing alternative text for images, using semantic HTML markup, and ensuring proper keyboard navigation." for myself in my "current work environment". How? Encouraging as many individuals as possible to use a website, regardless of their circumstances or skills, is known as accessibility. It guarantees all users, including those on sluggish networks, mobile users, and those with impairments, equal access and opportunities. It helps with SEO, public perception, and general usability and is both morally right and frequently legally mandated. This takes into account the needs of people with different disabilities, such vision impairments, for which they might need to utilize screen readers or magnifiers in order to view material.
Activity 2: "Paletton" [What activity did you complete?] In this activity, I learned "Paletton is a valuable tool for anyone involved in art and design, whether they are professionals or beginners. It simplifies the complexities of color theory, making it accessible to all users, regardless of their level of expertise. One of the primary features of Paletton is its color wheel, which allows users to explore different color combinations and schemes effortlessly. Users can choose a basic color and then experiment with various palettes to find inspiration for their projects. The tool encourages users to try different variations and to play with colors freely, without fear of making mistakes". [Provide supportive information from the activity you completed. ]
In this activity, I will be able to apply "Paletton is a user-friendly tool for exploring color combinations and schemes, suitable for professionals and beginners alike. It simplifies color theory, offering a color wheel and complementary color wheel to guide users in creating harmonious palettes. With features such as color scheme generation and code identification, Paletton enables users to experiment, refine, and perfect their color choices for various projects." for myself in my "current work environment". How?  Paletton offers tools such as the complementary color wheel, which helps users understand color harmony and create balanced compositions. Users can also generate color schemes based on predefined rules or customize their own schemes to suit their specific needs and preferences. Paletton further facilitates the color selection process by providing users with color codes (such as RGB, HEX, and   HSL) for each color in their chosen palette. This feature ensures consistency across different platforms and allows users to easily translate their color choices into various digital and print formats.
