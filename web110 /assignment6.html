<h1>Assignment 6 - Summary</h1>
Session 6- Internet Fundamentals/Networking
Activity 1: "Internet Reference Models" [What activity did you complete?] In this activity, I learned "the heterogeneous design of network devices dispersed across many geographic areas presents issues that are addressed by the Reference Model, which is crucial for standardizing worldwide communication in computer networks. A systematic framework for comprehending and executing network protocols is offered by two well-known reference models: the TCP/IP Model and the OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)." [Provide supportive information from the activity you completed. ]
In this activity, I will be able to apply "the seven levels that make up the International Organization of Standardization (ISO) OSI Model each have distinct roles. The Data Link Layer maintains synchronization and error control, the Network Layer routes signals, the Transport Layer chooses data transmission paths, the Presentation Layer guarantees information compatibility, the Session Layer controls conversations, and the Application Layer offers a variety of services. The Physical Layer initiates and maintains physical connections." for myself in my "current work environment". How? the host to network layer from the physical and data link layers. It consists of an application layer (which is akin to the OSI Layer), a transport layer that uses UDP for connectionless transmission and TCP for dependable, connection-oriented transmission, an internet layer that handles packets using the internet protocol (IP), and a host to network Layer that links hosts to networks with different protocols.
Activity 2: "Configuring your Mac’s network settings" [What activity did you complete?] In this activity, I learned "the setting up network settings on a Mac was an intimidating job that scared most users, much like doing intricate medical operations. Nonetheless, a lot has changed, and nearly everyone may now join and setup a network with ease. The method is easier if you already have internet access and have a broadband modem linked to a router that assigns local IP numbers." [Provide supportive information from the activity you completed. ]
In this activity, I will be able to apply "the router distributes internal IP addresses to devices within the local network, the internet service provider (ISP) allocates an IP address to your internet account, serving as the principal conduit to the internet. On your Mac, go to System Preferences, choose the Network setting, and deal with the intuitive interface that shows you your connections—active, possible, and inactive." for myself in my "current work environment". How? The pop up choice for Configure IPv4 usually says "Using DHCP," and it provides further information about search-domain information, router, subnet mask, and DNS server. Even though some of this material may appear technical, users may concentrate on important features because the interface is intended to be user friendly.
