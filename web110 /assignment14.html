<h1>Assignment 14 - Summary</hi>
  Activity 1: "SQL Statement" [What activity did you complete?] In this activity, I learned "use the SQL SELECT command to obtain data from a database. Using WHERE clauses to filter the results based on certain criteria, I also tried constructing simple SELECT queries to get particular columns or all columns from a table.". [Provide supportive information from the activity you completed. ]
In this activity, I will be able to apply "using this knowledge in my present job setting by learning how to get particular data out of our corporate database. The SQL SELECT statement with the right WHERE clauses, for example, may be used to extract the necessary data if I need to make a report of all active customers who are situated in a specific region. " for myself in my "current work environment". How? I improved my ability to formulate exact questions that would elicit pertinent data that would be useful to me. I was able to improve the quality and relevancy of my query results by filtering data based on predetermined conditions by understanding the basic syntax and utilizing WHERE clauses.
<h2>single-table SELECT statements</h2>
