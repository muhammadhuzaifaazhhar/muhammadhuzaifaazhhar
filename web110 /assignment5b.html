Session 5b - Internet Fundamentals/Communications
Activity 1: "Chrome Remote Desktop" [What activity did you complete?] In this activity, I learned "Google created Chrome Remote Desktop, a remote desktop program that allows users to remotely manage a computer's desktop via its own proprietary protocol called Chromoting. Since its original release on October 8, 2011, the program has changed, starting as a Chrome extension and progressing to a web portal that can be accessed at remotedesktop.google.com. It is also compatible with Android and iOS devices. Users must download a server package and have an extension-supporting Chromium browser in order to host remote access. Users may connect to their computers remotely thanks to the program, which stands out for permitting a persistent, pre-authorized connection to a remote computer. Chrome Remote Desktop offers a more convenient and long-lasting alternative than transient connections like remote assistance". [Provide supportive information from the activity you completed. ]
In this activity, I will be able to apply "Even though it supports capabilities like real-time audio feed under Windows and copying and pasting between devices, it is limited to 100 customers; any effort to add more will result in a "failed to register machine" message. As a useful tool for remote desktop access inside the Google ecosystem, the program has a unique protocol and is compatible with several systems". for myself in my "current work environment". How? The ability to create a persistent, pre-authorized connection to a distant computer is what sets Chrome distant Desktop different. With this feature, users may easily connect remotely to their computers without requiring additional permissions each time. Chrome Remote Desktop appears to be a more robust and user-friendly option when compared to more ephemeral options like Remote Assistance, which sometimes consist of brief connections.
Activity 2: "Skype" [What activity did you complete?] In this activity, I learned "microsoft's Skype is a feature rich communication tool that provides users with a variety of options for uninterrupted contact. Users may communicate personally and professionally by sending instant messages, participating in group video conferences, and making high quality audio and video conversations. Skype provides screen sharing for cooperative reasons in addition to file sharing, which lets users share documents and multimedia within the conversation.". [Provide supportive information from the activity you completed. ]
In this activity, I will be able to apply "users who have options for Skype Credit can contact landlines and mobile phones all across the world. Dedicated phone numbers are provided by Skype Numbers, improving accessibility. Skype's widespread appeal as a complete communication tool that links people across many devices and operating systems may be attributed to its integration with Microsoft services, cross-platform accessibility, and strong security protocols." for myself in my "current work environment". How? File sharing, which enables users to communicate a range of documents and multimedia immediately within the chat interface, is one feature that demonstrates the platform's adaptability. The capability of screen sharing, which permits the real-time sharing of desktop displays, greatly supports collaborative tasks.
