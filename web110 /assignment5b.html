Since its original release on October 8, 2011, the program has changed, starting as a Chrome extension and progressing to a web portal that can be accessed at remotedesktop.google.com. It is also compatible with Android and iOS devices. Users must download a server package and have an extension-supporting Chromium browser in order to host remote access.
